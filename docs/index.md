# Cartwright

Cartwright is a tool designed to automatically infer metadata on features in a dataset.

It provides several heuristic and neural-based methods for analyzing dataset features and annotating. For example, Cartwright can infer that a feature column consists of dates, determine what the datetime format is, and predict the frequency of data measurements (e.g. hours, days, weeks, etc).

Cartwright provides analysis across a variety of different [categories](./categories) of data, mainly focused on Geospatial and Temoporal features.
